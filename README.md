# MAPF-POST

:warning: Exprimental code, currently under construction

This Rust crate provides tools for extracting semantic plans from Multi-Agent Path Finding (MAPF) solutions. Executing MAPF plans in real-world robotic systems is a complex task, often hindered by both unknown robot model factors (e.g., imperfect kinematics, sensor noise) and dynamic environmental factors (such as unforeseen obstacles or changing layouts). By providing a high-level semantic representation of the plan, this crate significantly improves the feasibility and robustness for the practical execution of these MAPF plans.
